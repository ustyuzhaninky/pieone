The raw gas mixture flows through the tube space of the heat exchangers [b][color=#d32f2f]H1[/color][/b], [b][color=#d32f2f]H2[/color][/b], [b][color=#d32f2f]H3[/color][/b], where
reaction products from the reactor [b][color=#d32f2f]R1[/color][/b] heat it. Then it sent to the furnace [b][color=#d32f2f]F1[/color][/b].
The raw material heated in the furnace [b][color=#d32f2f]F1[/color][/b] to a temperature of 320-280 C enters the reactor [b][color=#d32f2f]R1[/color][/b] and passes down
the catalyst layer, where the processes of hydro desulfurization and enriching of diesel fuel.
To lower the temperature, as well as to reduce the process of coke formation and prolong the service
life of the catalyst, a supply of cold circulating HCG from the compressor outlet [b][color=#d32f2f]C1[/color][/b] goes to the middle part
of the reactor [b][color=#d32f2f]R1[/color][/b] (between the catalyst layers). The product from the reactor [b][color=#d32f2f]R1[/color][/b] passes sequentially through the tube
space of the heat exchangers [b][color=#d32f2f]H1[/color][/b], [b][color=#d32f2f]H2[/color][/b], [b][color=#d32f2f]H3[/color][/b].
